description: "I am not going to waste time explaining or advocating how popular JavaScript is as of the current date, 03-04-2023. In this blog, we will explore the history of JavaScript, which has been neglected by most, making it an unheard-of history of JavaScript. I will cover what was happening before the birth of JS, the circumstances at that time, and what happened to JavaScript after its development.

### Background Story

To picture how javascript was born we had to go back to the history of the internet, which mainly started in 1960 when the US Department of Defence funded a research in ARPANET agency to find a decentralised way of communication so they can use it in war-like situations. In 1969 ARPA successfully connected California university to Stanford university via a connection that marked the birth of the internet, as the following years they connected a number of computers. MeanWhile in 1990 Tim Berner Lee who was working at a European organisation for nuclear research developed the first web browser called world wide web and the first web server.

In January 23, 1993 National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released a web browser called mosaic which was the first user-friendly browser in which Image tag was introduced and developed by Eric Bina and Marc Andressen.

A bunch of people who were part of the mosaic project flew to California and joined Netscape (now Mozila) and developed the most modern web browser at that time called Navigator. It was a huge hit in the market and disrupted everything. Now Netscape was planning for the Navigator 2, they wanted to make browser more interactive so they can use it for Ecommerce for that they gave this job to Brendan Eich to develop a prototype of an interactive web browser in 10 days,

So brendan came up with the idea of a new language called Mocha and then LiveScript. Brendan mixed up three languages Java, Self and scheme and came up with the LiveScript and It was an amazing invention.

During this period Sun microsystem with there language Java developed a web browser called Hot java also become successful, So sun microsystem at that time campaigning about Java is the feature and donâ€™t depend on the Operating system instead of that use browser this was the same goal of Netscape so they decide to site and talk, Sun microsoft first propose to kill LiveScript and use only Java they ended up on java is hard to learn for beginners so they agreed on using livescript in browser but changed the name to livescript to javascript and they did a pressed released in december 1995 announcing a little brother of Java called Javascript which was completely lied they are two different language.

On the other hand microsoft was not in the browser world but when they realised that the both companies in silicon valley are trying to destroy microsoft they bought a browser from spyglass company and refactor it called internet explorer and also come up with their own Javascript called JScript because Sun Microsystem had the trademark of the word of Java.
Now Netscape got alarmed that microsoft was going to get the control of javascript. They thought javascript should be standardised so they approached ECMA, Finally javascript got standardised in 1997 and again the name changed to ECMAScript.
