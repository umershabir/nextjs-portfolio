This is a little tale of Zachariah's son Yahya (John) (Peace and blessings) who was the companion of Jesus. I read this in Qasasul Ambia (Stories of Prophets) about 2 years ago. After reading, I spent some time pondering on this and discovered some of the valuable things which I want to share in this blog.

### A little tale

Some kids between 8 to 10 were playing, one of them asked Yahya (peace and blessings) who was crossing from 'Hey Yahya why don't you join us?'
'I am not meant to play, I am for something else'

This sentence

> 'I am for something else'

How can a kid of 8 can say that? This was so curious for me that I started researching on that and what I found is really worthy.  
So, out of my curiosity just to find the answer I started from the Quran, where I found this in chapter 19 ‘Maryam’ in verse 7.

> “O, Zachariah! Lo, we bring the glad tiding of a son, named “Yahya(- John)” We have made none like him before this” [Quran: 19-7].

Again I was scratching my head. God himself said I am going to give you a son that I haven't made any human before like that so the next question was what was so special in Yahya? That God is claiming I haven’t made anyone like him before.

Luckily I found the answer to this question just after reading the next verses of the same chapter which says.

> “We granted him Wisdom while still a child.” [Quran: 19-12]

Until now It was okay, So that’s why Yahya said I meant something else because God granted him wisdom yet a child. But it popped up me to a new question. What wisdom is actually?

Here’s what I found the best one:

> All animals can think but humans can think deeply over something and Wisdom is the ability to think deeply and unbiased over a choice.

### Conclusion

And what I conclude is that every person with this kind of attitude who has parameters to say to unnecessary stuff is not meant for me or values his limited time or may be he is a responsible person ( note: highest responsibilities are our goals) has the same wisdom that God granted to Yahya while a child.

And here what I found what Quran says about wisdom in chapter 2:

> “He grants wisdom to whomever He wishes, and he, who is given wisdom, is certainly given abundant wealth”. [Quran: 2-269].

Thanks for reading and being here. I hope you get the point what I try to explain
